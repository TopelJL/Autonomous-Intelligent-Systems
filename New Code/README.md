# Our New implementation will include a Neural Network based approach with the help of reinforcement learning to integrate SLAM mapping environment and achieve safe autonomous navigation in apriori unknown enviornments.

# This will be achieved in 4 sections in our architecture:
- Simulation Environment.
- Building a neural network.
- Training the model using reinforcement learning.
- Testing and Validation of our simulation.
