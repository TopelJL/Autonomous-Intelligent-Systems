## Contributions to the work.
- Significant contributions have been made to this work such as developing an actual controller that is not hard coded at each time step to have a specific heading.
- Integrate noise succesfully into the sensor readings of the vehicles position to simulate a real wold environment.
- Integrate the environment to function with multiple vehicles, allowing both vehicles to have their own controller that will sense both vehicles and obstacles and safely navigate towards their desired goal.
